# Data-Analysis-and-Linear-Regression
The attached dataset “diabetic_kidney_disease.csv” contains 110 records of patients with 
diabetic kidney disease. We need to examine the relation between fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) because kidney disease is a common complication 
of diabetes.
it is a python program that uses linear regression with gradient descent to predict the value 
of UACR based on the FBG of a patient since this value can be used for early detection of kidney 
disease in diabetic patients
